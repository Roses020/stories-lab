my experience building my first project from scratch:

Building my first project was intimidating and fun at the same time. This was where i really got to implement everything i learned 
and see it come together in one place. I had to figure out how to put all the code and tecknology together from looking at demos and 
previos labs and getting ideas on how to go about it, what files to create and using boiler plate code to get started. Its fun to google things
and figure out how to make everything work i loved using css to style the page and figuring out how to implement all the REST methods.
the tecknologys i used where javascript,html,css, and axios,I used those tecknologys because i needed to practice what i learnded during my 
first 7 weeks at devmountain.




Realizing i had a bug in my code:

After finishing my first project and recording it i realized there was a bug in the delete function. i was using a function that had a for loop
and it was using the splice method to delete an item  off the list but the problem was that the splice method was modifying the original
array and the loop length changed everytime it deleted something from the array. so i commented out the for loop and replaced it using a filter 
method and that fixed the bug.
